Smart Parking System (Arduino + Ultrasonic Sensors)
The Smart Parking System is an Arduino-based project that uses ultrasonic sensors to monitor the availability of parking slots in real time. Each slot is scanned, and the system determines whether it is ENGAGED or AVAILABLE based on the measured distance.

 Key Features
1) Monitors 3 parking slots using ultrasonic sensors
2) Displays slot status (ENGAGED / AVAILABLE) via Serial Monitor
3) Distance-based detection for accurate monitoring
4) Expandable design for more slots and automation

 Tools & Components
1) Arduino Uno / Mega/node mcu
2) 3 x Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)
3) Servo motor
4) Jumper wires & Breadboard
5) (Optional) LED indicators for each slot

Applications
1) Smart parking management in malls, offices, apartments
2) Real-time vehicle detection and monitoring
3) Can be extended with IoT & display modules
